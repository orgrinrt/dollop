## Features

| Feature  | Status      | Description                                           |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `tlsf`   | üöß Unstable | tlsf (two-level segregated fit) allocator             |
| `no_std` | üöß Unstable | support for environments without the standard library |
| `std`    | ‚ùìPlanned    | standard library support                              |

## Usage

### Basic TLSF Allocator Setup

```rust

```

## Example

```rust

```

### In practice

## Compatibility

This crate requires rust `1.64.0` or later.

For practical reasons, we pin the msrv there to utilize ver `1.64.0` cargo's stabilized
`workspace-inheritance` feature, but also to remain fairly compatible.

### Versioning policy

Minor versions may have breaking changes, which can include bumping msrv.

Patch versions are backwards compatible, so using version specifiers such as `~x.y` or `^x.y.0` is safe.
